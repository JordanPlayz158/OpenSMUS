        <td align="left" valign="top"><p><span class="margin">OpenSMUS</span> servers support all the DBObject commands
            used in Shockwave MultiUser Server 2 and 3, and some new ones. These cover all DBAdmin, DBApplication,
            DBUser and DBPlayer functions. Older database commands used in SMUS 1 have been deprecated by Macromedia,
            and are NOT supported by <span class="margin">OpenSMUS</span>. A list of all commands and their syntax is
            available in the Command List section of this document.</p>
            <p class="margin">The OpenSMUS download contains a package with <a
                    href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/hsqldb/">HSQL Database engine</a> classes . HSQLDB is free for
                redistribution and inclusion in commercial and non-commercial projects. All source code changes made by
                the Tabuleiro team to the HSQL engine were available to the HSQLDB developer community as part of the
                1.6.1 release, when we joined the development team for the project briefly in late 2001. HSQLDB is a
                very fast in-memory 100% Java database tool, and it runs in the same VM session of the OpenSMUS server
                for the best possible performance. </p>
            <p class="margin">There is no configuration or installation needed to use databases in OpenSMUS. The server
                will automatically create and initialize a default database the first time it is started. The following
                files will be created in the server directory:</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="marginbold">OpenSMUSDB.data</p>
            <p class="marginbold">OpenSMUSDB.backup</p>
            <p class="marginbold">OpenSMUSDB.script</p>
            <p class="marginbold">OpenSMUSDB.properties</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>These files contain the cached version of the database. It is recommended that at least one
                administrative user is created in the database, to allow access to administrative database and server
                administration commands in the future. This can be accomplished with the &quot;CreateUser&quot;
                directive in the OpenSMUS.cfg file:</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="marginbold">CreateUser = admin,pass,100</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>This command will create a user names &quot;admin&quot;, with password &quot;pass&quot; and userlevel 100
                the next time the server is started. We have authored a Director tool called &quot;DatabaseAdministrator&quot;
                that is available in the DOWNLOAD section of the OpenSMUS site to make it easier to manipulate and
                administrate the database contents. But you can also use any other Director movie to interface with the
                database, as long as it uses the supported DBObject commands.</p>
