            MultiUserServer, a commercial product, and released as open source software in January 1st, 2009, as a gift
            to the worldwide community of Director developers. </p>
            <p class="margin">Commercial support for both existing Nebulae customers and new OpenSMUS users is available
                for purchase from the <a href="http://xtras.tabuleiro.com">xtras.tabuleiro.com</a> website, as well as
                custom server side scripting and additions. Please contact mauricio at tabuleiro.com for inquiries.</p>
            <p class="margin">As the community around the open source edition develops, the OpenSMUS will be updated
                with additional resources for technical support. At this time two forums are already provided at <a
                        href="http://opensmus.sf.net">opensmus.sf.net</a> for discussion and peer support.</p></td>
